A game made in android studio where you catch pokeballs with pikachu! The balls fall down quickly and you have to move pikachu to catch each of them. However, it's a game over if you miss three. The game is meant to be a relaxing experience that takes a bit of focus. A calming pokemon song plays in the background (Verdanturf Town) while you play. Pikachu greets you at the start screen and then makes a sad noise when you lose. It can run on desktop, android and iOS.
